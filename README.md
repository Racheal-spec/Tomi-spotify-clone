# Spotify Clone Application

This is a front-end clone of the Spotify web player. The UI was modeled after the Spotify desktop app interface using React Js, Spotify Web API, Redux for state management, and Material UI for styling.
Users can log in to the application with their Spotify account details, view playlists, select preferred playlist and listen to their favorite music.

## Requirements 

- You must be using a Spotify premium account.
- Your Spotify email must be added to the app dashboard as a user. 

To do that, please send me your Spotify email on Twitter-[@theracheltomi](https://twitter.com/racheltomidev) or send an email to [tomisinrachel@gmail.com](mailto:tomisinrachel@gmail.com).
